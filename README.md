# Breast Cancer Classification using Logistic Regression

This project applies **Logistic Regression** to classify breast cancer tumors as **Benign** or **Malignant** using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset** from Kaggle.  

The goal is to build a simple but effective predictive model for early detection of breast cancer, which is a critical step in assisting doctors with diagnosis.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)  
- **Features:** 30 numerical features computed from digitized images of breast masses (radius, texture, smoothness, etc.)  
- **Target:**  
  - `0` → Malignant (cancerous)  
  - `1` → Benign (non-cancerous)  
- **Samples:** 569 total

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Environment:** Google Colab  
- **Libraries Used:**  
  - `numpy`  
  - `pandas`  
  - `matplotlib` / `seaborn` (for visualization)  
  - `scikit-learn` (for preprocessing, model training & evaluation)  


## 🚀 Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
   - Import dataset, inspect features, check for missing values  
   - Visualize class distribution  

2. **Data Preprocessing** 
   - Train-test split  

3. **Model Building**
   - Logistic Regression model using Scikit-learn  

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy Score  


## 📈 Results

- **Accuracy Achieved:** ~95% (depending on random split)  
- Logistic Regression proved effective in distinguishing between benign and malignant cases.
